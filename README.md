# Signals Final Project
A simple 'Motion Detection' Python program using OpenCV (`cv2`), designed as a "Red Light, Green Light Game" / "Squid Game".

## Requirements
- `imutils`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`

## TODO
- Make the code modular
- Add a sensitivity adjustment for motion detection
- Enhance motion detection accuracy
- Improve game feedback (e.g., sounds, lights)
- Optimize the code performance
- Design a better user interface
- Incorporate a "Squid Game" / "Red Light, Green Light" theme
- Improve the visualization of detected movement
- Enhance the game phase logic (e.g., transition between phases)
- Add more dynamic intervals or varying durations for the "Stop" and "Go" phases
- Optimize performance (e.g., reduce lag, improve frame processing)
- Conduct testing and debugging to ensure reliability and stability
